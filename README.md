I created a compelling Power BI dashboard by leveraging SQL and the AdventureWorks2022 database. The dashboard is created for analyzing various details of product datasets, 
I used interactive mapviews, slicer, line charts, and tables that presented data in a user-friendly manner.

The following are the visuals inclued in the dashboard:
1. Used card for showing Total Revenue, Overall Profit and Profit Margin
2. Used mapview to show sales in each country/territory and slicer to select and filter the countries
3. Used donut chart to show the Number of Products and percentage in each Category
4. Used table to show sales figures of Top 10 selling Products
5. Used line chart to show variations in the number of Online and Store purchases over the years
